## Setup

### Packages Used

```{r loadpackages}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(magrittr)
```

### Datasets Used

### Background of the Data

The datasets were downloaded from [Disney+ Movies and TV Shows | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/disney-movies-and-tv-shows) and [TV shows on Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu and Disney+ | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/tv-shows-on-netflix-prime-video-hulu-and-disney). You can read about them there, including variable definitions, sources, when they were created, and other information. Load the two datasets and use `glimpse()` to explore their structures.

#### Disney+ Dataset

```{r loaddisneydata}
disney_data <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZoeRobino/STT2860S22project2/main/data/disneypluscontent.csv")

glimpse(disney_data)

```

#### Streaming Dataset

```{r loadstreamingdata}
streaming_data <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scampbell04/STT2860S22project2/main/data/streamingcontent.csv")

glimpse(streaming_data)

```

## Analyses

### Create the Analysis Datasets

#### Dataset #1

The Disney+ dataset contains a variable that gives information about the `rating` for each program offering. Convert the variable into a factor that puts the ratings in (roughly) ascending order of age restriction/audience: `TV-Y`, `TV-Y7`, `TV-Y7-FV`, `TV-G`, `G`, `TV-PG`, `PG`, `PG-13`, `TV-14`. If the `date_added` variable is not already in date format, convert it.  

```{r factorratings}
disney_data <- disney_data %>% 
  arrange(factor(rating, levels=c("TV-Y", "TV-Y7", "TV-Y7-FV", "TV-G", "G", "TV-PG", "PG", "PG-13", "TV-14"))) 
glimpse(disney_data)
  
```

#### Dataset #2

From the streaming content dataset, create a new dataset by doing the following.

* Use `pivot_longer()` to gather the `Netflix`, `Hulu`, `Prime Video`, and `Disney+` variables into columns called `Service` (containing the name of the streaming service) and `YesNo` (showing the 0/1 indicator values from the original columns).
* After pivoting, filter the dataset to remove any row where `YesNo == 0` (i.e., a show is *not* on the service).
* Split the `IMDb` variable to separate the show rating from the max rating of `10`. Convert the show rating to a numerical variable.
* Split the `Rotten Tomatoes` variable to separate the show rating from the max of `100`. Convert the show rating to a numerical variable.

```{r pivotlong}
streaming_data %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = 'Netflix':'Disney+',
               names_to = 'Service',
               values_to = 'YesNo') %>%
  filter(YesNo == 1) 
  #separate(col='IMDB',
           #into= "Rating",
           #sep = "10",
           #remove = TRUE,
           #convert = FALSE,
           #extra="warn",
           #fill = "warn")

  #mutate(name = str_remove(name, '(off|pt)_')) %>% 
  #spread(name, value) %>% 
  #select(-loc)

```

### Visualization 1: Violin Plot                  

**This plot uses Dataset #1.**

Create a violin plot of `release_year` (x-axis) grouped by `type` of program (y-axis) for programs on Disney+. Fill with a color of your choice. Add a boxplot inside the violin plot, as you did in one of the DataCamp exercises. Re-scale the x-axis so that tick marks appear at whole-decade intervals (e.g., 1980, 1990, 2000). Add an appropriate title and axis labels. Use other formatting as you choose to enhance effectiveness/appearance.

```{r violinplot}
ggplot(disney_data, aes(x = 'release_year', y = 'type', color= "red")) + geom_violin(aes(x = 'Release Year', y = 'Type',)) + geom_boxplot() + ggtitle('Type of Movies Released Over The Years')

```

### Visualization 2: Waffle Plot

**This plot uses Dataset #1.**

Create a waffle plot to show the distribution of program `type` on Disney+. 

* Give the plot the title "Streaming Content on Disney+". 
* Change the colors of the squares to something other than the defaults.
* Use an x-axis label to indicate roughly how many programs each square represents.

Hint: Use `round(100 * prop.table(table(DATASETNAME$VARIABLENAME)))` to create the input data for the waffle plot. Swap out the capital letter placeholders for the correct dataset name and variable name.

```{r waffleplot}

```

### Visualization 3: Ratings Bar Plot

**This plot uses Dataset #1.**

Create a horizontal barplot to show the frequencies of the various `rating` categories for programs on Disney+ (i.e., use `y =` rather than `x =` for the variable you are plotting). **You will need to remove a couple `NA` values first.** Facet by `type` so that you have side-by-side plots for the two different program types. Add an appropriate title and axis labels, as well as other formatting to enhance effectiveness/appearance. 

```{r ratingsbarplot}

```

### Visualization 4: Services Bar Plot

**This plot uses Dataset #2.**

Create a barplot to display how many shows are offered on each of the four streaming services. Choose appropriate colors, labels, themes, and/or and other types of formatting that you feel will enhance the meaning or visual appearance of the plot. 

```{r showsbarplot}

```

### Visualization 5: Choose a Plot!

Create one other plot of your choice using either dataset to explore a question of interest. You are welcome to perform additional manipulations on the data, if needed. Add an appropriate title and axis labels, as well as any other necessary formatting.

```{r}

```
