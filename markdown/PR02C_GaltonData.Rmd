### Datasets Used

#### Background of the Data

Francis Galton, a cousin of Charles Darwin, studied the relationship between parent heights and the heights of their offspring. His pioneering [1886 article](https://galton.org/essays/1880-1889/galton-1886-jaigi-regression-stature.pdf) is the first appearance of regression analysis in print. He originated many statistical terms and concepts, including regression, correlation, deviate, quartile, and percentile, plus median for the midpoint of a distribution. The `galtonheightdata` dataset was [created under the direction of Dr. James A. Hanley](http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/epidemiology/hanley/galton/) using Galton's [original paper notebooks](http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/epidemiology/hanley/galton/notebook/index.html) containing the measurement data. You can access the `galtonfamiliesmain.csv` and `galtonfamiliessub.csv` datasets from the [description](https://stat-jet-asu.github.io/Datasets/InstructorDescriptions/galtonheightdata.html) page. A third dataset, `galtonfamiliesnotebook.csv`, shows the notebook page on which each family's information was recorded.

#### Galton Main Dataset

## Analyses

### Create the Analysis Datasets

#### Dataset #1

Load the three Galton datasets and use `glimpse()` to explore their structures. Refer to Project 1 and use the new data binding/joining skills you have learned to assemble a single dataset that meets the following criteria. Use `glimpse()` and `head()` to display the result. (Hint: Use `bind_rows()` to connect the `main` and `sub` datasets, then use a join to add the `notebook` information.)

* contains these variables:
   * `familyid` = ID number of the family, with `136A` recoded as `205`
   * `page` = the notebook page on which the family is recorded
   * `num_children`= the number of children in the family
   * `father_ht` = the height of the father
   * `mother_ht` = the "transmuted" (per Galton) height of the mother
   * `midparent` = the average of the parents' heights (using transmuted mother)
   * `child_sex`= whether the child is a son or a daughter, in all lower case
   * `child_ht` = the height of the child with daughter heights "transmuted"
   
* is arranged according to:
   * ascending order of familyid
   * sons before daughters within family
   * in order of height within each sex of child

```{r assembledata1}
bind_rows(data_main, data_sub) -> data_new
merge(x=data_new, y=data_notebook, by="familyID") %>%
  arrange(familyID,
          factor(child_gen, levels=c('Son','Daugter')),
          height) -> data_all
glimpse(data_all)
```


#### Dataset #2

From Dataset #1, select the variables `familyid` and `num_children`, then reduce the dataset so it contains only one unique row per family. Use `glimpse()` to display the result. (Hint: The final dataset should have 205 rows/observations and two variables/columns.)

```{r assembledata2}
dataset_2 <- data_all %>%
  select(familyid = familyID,
         num_children = child_num) %>%
  distinct()
glimpse(dataset_2)
```

### Visualization 1: Updated Scatterplot

#### Galton's Visualization

In his original paper (linked above), Galton created several tables and diagrams. His "Diagram Based on Table 1" of them is similar in concept to a scatterplot. Rather than dots, he grouped/tabulated the data, and then used the count of how many people were grouped at the coordinate pairs in his grid, with child as the x-axis and mid-parent as the y-axis. There are two scales: inches and deviations from 68.25 inches.

```{r galtonscatterplot, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "../images/galtonplot.png")
```

#### Your Data Visualization

**This plot uses Dataset #1.**

Create a scatterplot of child height (x-axis) versus mid-parent height (y-axis). Ordinarily, we might reverse the axes here because analysts would be more likely to model child height as a function of parent height, but we want to be able to compare the updated plot to Galton's original.

Include the following.

* make your dots larger than the default size to help show density
* set transparency to adjust for overplotting and help show density
* use `color =` in the `aes` to differentiate sons versus daughters
* use `scale_color_manual()` to choose two colorblind-safe colors
* scale both axes so that there is a tick mark at every whole inch
* use `coord_fixed()` so that the axes have the same unit spacing
* add better x- and y-axis labels, including the units of measure
* add an informative title (you may optionally include a subtitle)
* add `color =` to `labs()` to set the legend title to `"gender of child"` 
* use a built-in theme (e.g., `theme_linedraw()`) to add formatting
* use `theme()` to move the legend to the bottom of the scatterplot

```{r updatedscatterplot}
p1 <- ggplot(data_all, aes(x=height, y=midparent, color=child_gen)) +
  geom_point(alpha=.45, size=2.5) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#FFB000","#648FFF")) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks= 55:80) + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks= 64:76) + 
  coord_fixed() + 
  labs(color = "Gender of child", title = "Average of the parentsâ€™ heights versus the height of children by gender", x = "Childrens height in inches", y="Parents height in inches") + 
  theme_linedraw()
p1 + theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

### Visualization 2: Number of Children

**This plot uses Dataset #2.**

Create a barplot to show the distribution of the number of children per family. Set the bars to something other than the default `width`. Scale the x-axis so that there is a tick mark for each bar. Choose appropriate colors, labels, themes, and/or and other types of formatting that you feel will enhance the meaning or visual appearance of the plot.  (Hint: Use `count()` to find out how many families have a given number of children, then use that information to create your plot.)

```{r childrenbarplot}
ggplot(dataset_2, aes(num_children)) +
  geom_bar(width = 1, color = "white", fill = "#DC267F") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks= 0:15) +
  labs(title = "Number of children per family", x = "Number of children", y="Number of families") +
  geom_text(aes(label = ..count..), stat = "count", vjust = -.3, size = 3.5) +
  theme_linedraw()

```

## Questions

**Question 1:** Do you think your scatterplot is an improvement over Galton's original diagram? Are there any other modifications and/or additions you would make to enhance the clarity or usefulness of your plot?

**ANSWER**

I feel that our updated scatterplot is an improvement to Galton's original diagram beacuse it is visually cleaner. Something that I think would be interesting to add would be a regression line to see how strong of a correlation there is between the two heights.

**Question 2:** Explain the rationale behind the choices you made when creating your scatterplot and barplot, such as size, color, transparency, or other features. What motivated your decisions? 

**ANSWER**

All three colors I used for both plots came directly from the [IBM "color blind safe" palette](https://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind/#%23648FFF-%23785EF0-%23DC267F-%23FE6100-%23FFB000), and I made sure to use two tones that could not be confused in certain spectra for the scatterplot. I also wanted to clearly show density so I opted for 40% opacity and a larger dot size so that it would still be visible. The barplot was fairly simple because I wanted it to look clean, but I added the bar values for ease of reading.



**Question 3:** Considering best practices, how does using `coord_fixed()` enhance the authenticity of the information shown in the scatterplot, such as the relationship and spread of the data?

**ANSWER**

Using `coord_fixed()` helps insure that the spread has not been stretched out or shrunk so that we can more easily see the correlation.
